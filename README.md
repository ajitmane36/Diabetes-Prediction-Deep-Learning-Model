# Diabetes-Prediction-Deep-Learning-Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes risk. The project involves training various machine learning models, including Random Forest, SVM, and deep learning models. The best-performing model, Random Forest, achieved the highest F1 score and was identified as the optimal model for predicting diabetes risk.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling class imbalance, and splitting the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Multiple ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost.
- **Deep Learning**: A custom-built Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics include F1 score, accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Model Compression**: The best model is saved as a compressed file using the `bz2file` library to reduce its size for easy deployment and sharing.
